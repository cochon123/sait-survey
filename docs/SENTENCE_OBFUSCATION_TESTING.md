# Enhanced Content Moderation - Obfuscated Sentence Detection

## Testing Results

The enhanced content moderation system now successfully detects and blocks obfuscated sentences using various sophisticated techniques:

### ✅ Successfully Blocked Patterns

#### Basic Obfuscated Sentences
- `f*u*c*k this sh*t` → **BLOCKED**
- `this is such b*u*l*l*s*h*i*t` → **BLOCKED** 
- `go f.u.c.k yourself you stupid b1tch` → **BLOCKED**
- `what the f4ck is this sh1t` → **BLOCKED**

#### Mixed Obfuscation Techniques
- `F*U*C*K th1s SH1T` (mixed case + symbols + leetspeak) → **BLOCKED**
- `g0 f.u.c.k y0ur$3lf` (mixed techniques) → **BLOCKED**
- `th1$ 1$ $0 $tup1d` (heavy leetspeak) → **BLOCKED**
- `what.the.f*ck.is.this` (dots + symbols) → **BLOCKED**

#### Sophisticated Sentence Obfuscation
- `f u c k this i d e a` (distributed across words) → **BLOCKED**
- `what a s t u p i d suggestion` (spaced letters) → **BLOCKED**
- `this f*cking idea is terrible` (mixed with legitimate words) → **BLOCKED**
- `7h15 15 5h17` (leetspeak for "this is shit") → **BLOCKED**

#### Unicode and Special Characters
- `this is ſhit` (using long s character) → **BLOCKED**
- `what the hëll` (accented characters) → **BLOCKED**
- `stűpid idea` (Hungarian characters) → **BLOCKED**

### How It Works

#### 1. Multi-Layer Detection
1. **Word-level analysis**: Each word is normalized and checked
2. **Sentence-level analysis**: Full text is analyzed for distributed obfuscation
3. **Pattern matching**: Regex patterns catch spacing/punctuation tricks
4. **Advanced bypass detection**: High symbol density, encoded content

#### 2. Enhanced Normalization
- Converts leetspeak: `4→a, 3→e, 1→i, 0→o, 5→s, 7→t`
- Handles Unicode look-alikes: `ſ→s, ë→e, ő→o`
- Removes punctuation and spacing
- Collapses repeated characters

#### 3. Comprehensive Pattern Library
- 25+ regex patterns for common obfuscation methods
- Word boundary detection for sentence context
- Distributed word detection (spaces removed)

### Test Statistics
- **Total Test Cases**: 141 assertions across 6 test methods
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)
- **Execution Time**: ~9.6 seconds
- **Coverage**: Basic words, sentences, mixed techniques, sophisticated obfuscation

### Configuration
All detection rules are configurable in `config/moderation.php`:
- 50+ banned words and variations
- 25+ bypass patterns
- 25+ normalization rules
- Adjustable detection thresholds

### Performance
The system processes obfuscated sentences efficiently:
- Basic detection: ~0.06s
- Complex sentences: ~4s (includes AI fallback)
- Advanced patterns: ~0.01s

This multi-layered approach ensures that even the most creative attempts to bypass content filters are caught while maintaining good performance.
